# EAAMO/MD4SG Data Challenge

Dear EAAMO/MD4SG,

As the holiday season twinkles upon us, an EAAMO/MD4SG Santa Claus, have a special challenge for you! This isn't just any ordinary task â€“ it's a merry journey through the world of data and analytics!

> "In my sack, I've got a dataset, as jolly as can be. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to predict 'y' based on 'X'. But hold your reindeers! We're not seeking perfect accuracy here. Instead, like a candy cane we seek let's make it simple and sweet."

Complete this challenge, and you'll earn a special place on my Nice List. Plus, there might just be a little surprise waiting for you in your stocking!

## ðŸŒˆ Rules: Santa's Guidelines

- **Keep it Merry and Bright**: Remember, we're here for holiday cheer, not just numbers and charts.
- **Simplicity is Key**: You don't need to dive into complex algorithms â€“ a simple approach will do.
- **Share the Joy**: Once you've created your data visualization, share it with your fellow elves. We're all about spreading cheer!
- **Enjoy the Process**: This challenge is about enjoying the journey, not just the destination.

Happy Data Exploring! ðŸŽ„âœ¨
